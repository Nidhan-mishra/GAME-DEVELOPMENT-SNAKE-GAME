This project is for a SNAKE GAME made in c++ and SFML graphics library it conatins main different files and classes that conatains the assetes,states,the main menu ,the gameplay ,pause menu , the gameover state and the main file. The player controlles the snake through the arrow keys and is tasked to eat the apples that get spawned randomly though out the game stage each time the player eats the apple the snake increase in size and if the snake collides (or eats itself)  the game ends also if the snake collides with the walls on the side than the game ends aswell. the snakes are represented by the sprites and each collision with the apple we add a sprite to the end of the snake tail the project also contains a simple state machine so that we can switch from the Main menu state to the gameplay state.The project takes refrences from youtube to understand SFML.The SFML graphics library provieds us to do all of the game logic with graphics.
